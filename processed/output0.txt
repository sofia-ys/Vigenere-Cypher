A coded journal was found behind the bookshelf, detailing an escape route used by spies during the occupation. The pages were filled with encrypted notes and coordinates. Each entry described a part of the operation, using aliases for names. Symbols replaced standard punctuation to confuse unintended readers. It is believed the journal belonged to a double agent who vanished after the war.
