Signals intercepted from a drifting satellite revealed a sequence of messages. Engineers noticed anomalies in the transmission that hinted at intelligent origin. Each message was encrypted using a classical cipher that resisted most brute-force attacks. As the data unfolded, a pattern emerged suggesting coordinates and event timings. Speculations ran wild — some believed it to be a test, others a real extraterrestrial broadcast.
